# ðŸ’¬ Q&A:
**ðŸ¤” How to install?**

[Download](https://github.com/Demon4u/CS2-Cheat/releases/tag/V1.0) full repo either from here or from "**Releases**", launch "**Loader.bat**" to install dependencies and enjoy.

**ðŸ¤” Is this detectable?**

This software operates in user mode, so it is entirely possible to be detected. However, you should always avoid suspicious gameplay to evade potential reports.

**ðŸ¤” Menu is laggy when toggling, any way to fix?**

Yes, enable developer console and run the following:

`engine_no_focus_sleep 0`
